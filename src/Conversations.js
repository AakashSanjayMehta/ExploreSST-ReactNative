    'I was so nervous I couldn‚Äôt sleep the night before I started school! üòÜ',
    'Officially, orientation starts on the first day of the year but SST prepares us from Registration Day.',
    'We get guidance on what‚Äôs to happen in the first week of school, how do we prepare for it, and of course booklists, uniforms and our learning device.',
    'The orientation itself is organised seniors in SST. For me, the experience was a fun one.',
    'You get to know the SST community and learn what is expected of all students.',
    'Because this is a small community, everyone looks out for one another.'

  SettlingIn: [
    'One of the early milestones you would face as an SST student is chosing a CCA.',
    'Since the cohort is a small one, we are told that the school will start new CCAs only if there is a sizeable number of interested students.',
    'But the truth is that our students have no problems finding a CCA that either helps to hone current skills and interests or uncover a hidden talent or passion.',
    'During the CCA tryouts, students are given the opportunity to attend any CCA session of their choice during a two-week trial period.',
    'Following the trial period, students would then indicate their preferred choice of CCA for the rest of their 4 years in SST.',
    'I had a hard time choosing but eventually went with my heart in choosing showchoir.',
    'Showchoir is a performing arts CCA in SST. Other categories are Sports and Games, Clubs and Societies and Uniform groups.',
    'I had seen clips of my seniors performing and was in awe.üò≤',
    'I‚Äôm finding out that getting to those standards of performance took a lot of effort and practice, not to mention team work.',
    'But as they say,‚ÄùNo pain, no gain.‚Äù. I want to gain the confidence to express myself and the strength to endure tough situations.',
    'So I‚Äôll break a leg, not literally of course. üòÑ ',

    'I‚Äôm not sure where to start but I‚Äôll try. ü§ó',
    'There are so many programmes spanned over the years that are available for the entire cohort.',
    'Experiences that students go through are interdisciplinary and built upon.',
    'For example, in Secondary 2, students go through the Investigative Skills in Science (ISS) programme, where they spend a term researching and developing a science project of their choice in place of regular classes.',
    'In Secondary 3, they can opt for the Industrial Research and Attachment Programme, where they are able to utilise their research skills depending on their projects.',
    'As you can see, programmes are integrated and pervasive.',
    'Have you ever heard of SST‚Äôs Talent Development Programme (TDP) ?',
    'It is a programme where every student is potentially a talent in some specific area(s) and SST has provisions in place to facilitate the identification and nurturing of each student‚Äôs specific talent based on his or her expressed area(s) of interest.',

  SSTINC: [
    'In SST Inc, you are first greeted with a rainbow ideation tunnel for students to discuss ideas and even scribble code on the wall. There are bean bags lying around to facilitate sharing sessions on programming languages and more!',
    'You see, SST Inc replicates a set-up of various companies within a conglomerate. If you‚Äôre really good, you can get ‚Äòpoached‚Äô by the best companies! Of course, there is a chance to get fired as well. ',
    'This is dependent on a year-end performance review conducted by the teachers. However, we feel that this is best as it helped students to build up competencies such as self-discipline, self-reflection, resilience and perseverance. ',
    'Companies here are run by students. Some of us are in an executive committee that comprises roles such as ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù, ‚ÄúCTO‚Äù. You get the gist.',
    'SST Inc has created many different apps over the years. What impressed me the most was this KK Hospital App, where students worked with KK Women‚Äôs and Children‚Äôs Hospital to develop the KKH Paediatrics Anaesthesia Handbook App. ',
    'It assists junior doctors in various areas such as administering the right dosage for anaesthesia based on patient profile, example being weight, age.',

  ISS: [
    'ISS stands for Investigative Skills in Science (ISS). We spend one term in Secondary 2 developing a science project in place of regular classes. ',
    'I feel that the ISS provides us with self-directedness and independence as we explore the topic of our interest (Yes, we get to choose our own topics!).',
    'We are also encouraged to hone our creativity and collaborative skills as we work as a group. Not to mention, there is a need to schedule our time wisely. ',
    'One interesting project that my schoolmates worked on includes investigation of the digestion time of various starchy substances.',
    'Their experiment helped establish which type of starchy food is most suitable for patients to consume when they are affected with different types of diseases. I feel that this app will really help the patients in terms of calibrating the right food choices!',

    'I‚Äôm really interested in Biotech because I love Biology.',
    'If you were wondering what is the difference between Biotech and Biology, Biology is a science, whereas biotechnology is an industry.',
    'To explain further, biology is concerned with living things whereas biotechnology uses knowledge from a variety of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, bioinformatics, genetic engineering and manufacturing processes.',
    'The subject of biotechnology is distinct from biology; while biology studies basic processes of living organisms, biotechnology is the application of biology to solve problems and improve lives.',
    'How great is it to use our application of knowledge to better the world?',

    'If you haven‚Äôt already heard from Rachel, the ChangeMakers Programme provides students with an integrated learning experience towards developing the attitudes and attributes of an innovator with an entrepreneurial mind.',
    'The programme synergises principles, knowledge and skills relating to design, innovation and entrepreneurship, information and communication technology, mathematics and science.',
    'Students learn to apply design thinking as an integral part of the innovation process to conceive ideas that improve the lives of people. Industry partners provide students with insights of real-world applications, and where possible, mentor students on projects.',
    'When we are back in Singapore, we reflect on their overseas learning experiences and work together as teams of advocates to research into their area of community concerns and work on advocacy campaigns.',
    'The ChangeMakers Innofest‚Äôs intended outcome is for the Sec 2 cohort to be able to appreciate, understand and apply the content and skills acquired in the ChangeMaker‚Äôs programme, through the creation and presentation of their proposed solutions to the given challenges. #SSTudents also build on the experience from the 3M InnoScience Challenge that they took part in in Secondary One. ',
    'In 2018, the main theme was ‚ÄòThe Elderly Challenge‚Äô, where students were tasked to work on developing proposals that could lead to a better quality of life for our elderly, both now, and more specifically beyond 2030.',

    'On the first day, Keynote speaker Dr Radiah Salim, Founder of Club HEAL, spoke to the students on The New Orphans - elderly in Singapore and challenges that they face. With the context set, students then went on learning journeys to venues such as SAGE CC, ClubHEAL, Jamiyah Nursing Home and Apple Inc.',
    'In the next 2 days, students spent the whole night coding and developing our prototypes, working under a hackathon format.  Although we were tired on the last day, we were energised by the idea of presenting our ideas to the judges.'
