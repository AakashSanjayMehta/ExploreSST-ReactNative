  SettlingIn: [

    'Since the cohort is a small one, we are told that the school will start new CCAs only if there is a sizeable number of interested students.',
    'But the truth is that our students have no problems finding a CCA that either helps to hone current skills and interests or uncover a hidden talent or passion.',
    'During the CCA tryouts, students are given the opportunity to attend any CCA session of their choice during a two-week trial period.',
    'Following the trial period, students would then indicate their preferred choice of CCA for the rest of their 4 years in SST.',
    'I had a hard time choosing but eventually went with my heart in choosing showchoir.',
    'Showchoir is a performing arts CCA in SST. Other categories are Sports and Games, Clubs and Societies and Uniform groups.',

    'So I‚Äôll break a leg, not literally of course. üòÑ ',
