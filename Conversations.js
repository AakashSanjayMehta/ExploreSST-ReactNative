  CareerFairGuidanceTalks: [
    "What about the Education and Career Guidance(ECG) in SST?",
    "Although I'll be graduating this year, I am definitely looking forward to my post-secondary education. Initially, I remember having anxieties but I no longer feel that way as SST has put in place a wide series of Education and Career Guidance (ECG) from Year 1 all the way to Year 4!",
    "There is a huge array of ECG programmes in SST such as assembly talks to help us find out more about JC, IB or Polytechnic education. Other than these talks, we are also exposed to Career Fairs, Industrial Attachments as well as our very own Secondary 4 Discover Programme that seeks to help us plan for our future ahead.",
    "Every year, SST combines the School-Parent Meeting with a Career Day @SST. SST's multi-pronged approach helps us to explore possible pathways such as Parent-teacher discussions on our progress and ways to support our learning needs and a Post-Secondary and Tertiary Education Fair.",
    "I am looking forward to seeing #SSTAlumni back at #SST to speak to us about their chosen pathways! Some of my classmate parents will also be involved in the Career Talks by sharing their occupation and what its like to work in their field.",
    "I am glad that these resources are so readily available here at SST."
